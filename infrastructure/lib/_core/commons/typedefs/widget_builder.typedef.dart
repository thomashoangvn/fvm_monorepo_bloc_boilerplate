/// A type alias for a function that builds a `Widget` using the provided `BuildContext`.
///
/// This is typically used in Flutter to create widgets dynamically, for example,
/// in navigation, dialog builders, or list builders.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// WidgetBuilder myWidgetBuilder = (BuildContext context) {
///   return Text('Hello, world!');
/// };
/// ```
///
/// This allows you to define widget-building functions that take in a `BuildContext`
/// and return a widget, which is essential in many parts of Flutterâ€™s widget tree.
